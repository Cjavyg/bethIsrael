            <p class="text-muted">Beth Israel Synagogue was started in 1923 by a group of men wishing to purchase a church on 7th Street and Elmer. They purchased said church for $13,000.00 and on December13th the Congregation was officially named "The Beth Israel Congregation" of Vineland, NJ . The years that followed were good for the congregation. It steadily grew and prospered, adding a Hebrew School, a Nursery School and a Library. By 1955 the congregation had grown to an all time high of 539 members requiring the Board to decide to build a new building. Ground was broken for a new building in April of 1957 and finished  and dedicated by April of 1958.This is the building we are still in today, many years later.</p></p>
